            <h1>Test <!-- Nick Anderson's Very Protected Work. --></h1>

            <p>
                The work I've done for the past two years has been some of my favorite,
                and at the same time, the hardest to show off to others.  Most of the work
                was created for an iPad webview app called iRep, which is used by pharmaceutical
                sales reps to showcase the benifits and precautions of certain medications. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Being the competitive industry that pharmaceutical is, most of what I've developed
                involve trade secrets, private medical information, and data still pending by the
                FDA.  As such I've had to take these precautions to ensure that me, my company, and 
                my client all stay out of legal trouble.
            </p>
              <p>
                  Below, you'll find three examples of my project that have been provided "raw" - 
                  each project was developed either specifically for a private iPad or touchscreen 
                  TV, so your web browser is not the best place to view them.  However, I've provided 
                  instructions on each to help walk you through how to get the most authentic experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  I'm also more than happy
                  to set up a private viewing in which I bring an iPad and let you move your way through
                  the app in all it's glory.
