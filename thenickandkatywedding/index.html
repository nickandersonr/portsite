                <h1>The room was dark.</h1>
                <p>
                    So dark I could only see her blue eyes because of the way the candle on the table caught them, like two windows lit up on a dark street. I searched them like a voyeur, trying to catch glimpses of whoever lived inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her hands were like exposed wire, sparking as I brushed mine against hers. I balanced my wrist on her knee, tracing the lines in her palm, looking for a clue - trying to find myself on its miniature canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her face was warmer than Texas, and maybe that’s why I leaned in - it reminded me of home.

                                            Sarah and Katy met when they were six years old, and it was friendship at first sight! They have been besties every since. Aside from Sarah's art skills, she can make anyone laugh with her jokes and she has a passion for weiner dogs and granola. Katy's favorite moment with Sarah was the day they wore a pizza hat and a lobster hat and volunteered to slather cream cheese on bagels for those in need.

                                            Alyssa and Katy bonded a few years ago over whiskey, Santa hats and international travel. Alyssa is quite a lady- currently working toward her PhD at Brown University while also developing a flair for snow since there is so much of it in Rhode Island. Katy and Alyssa once created a Christmas musical sandwich around Nick, and that's the moment Katy knew that she couldn't have asked for a better sister-in-law.

                                            Kim and Katy became instant friends in elementary school bonding over their mutual love of academics and life as only children. Kim is a multi-faceted gal with abilities ranging from acrobatic flying to calendar organization and much more. My favorite moment with Kim was two years ago when she tried to motivate my two cats to gallop like horses in order to shoot our Kanye West music video.

                                                Robyn and Katy have been partners in crime ever since the day in fifth grade when they started charging a quarter for counseling services. Robyn is a master technology doer, wine drinker and knows how to break it down to 'Rude Boy' by Rihanna. Some of Katy's favorite Robyn moments were late nights when she was snuggled up to the back of Robyn while riding on her scooter with the wind whisking their hair about.

Years later Nick would recognize this as the quintessential balance in their friendship, which has seen almost ten years of whiskey, Mario Kart, and Rod Stewart wigs.
Matt’s latest project has been automating his home with tiny robots like one of those Homes of Tomorrow cartoons.

Jeff is Nick’s writing partner and confidant, an emotional amplifier and grounding force in his life. They met many years ago when they were younger and stupider than they are now, and have kept the tradition alive ever since.  Jeff can be seen every Sunday in front of Whole Foods, yelling into a megaphone about the nearing End of Days.

                                            Chase was introduced to “Our” Earth through a rift in space-time in 2011, where he joined Nick working the web dev startup life.  With minimal supervision, Chase and Nick soon discovered their mutual love of video games at the arcade behind the office, creating a lifelong bond over gaming, art, and design.  When his people located Chase in 2014, he refused passage back to his world, stating “Earth home now”.

                                                One day a documentary will be made of Chandler’s quiet genius, and the spiral into madness it will inevitably lead to. Until then, Nick and Chandler combine their mental forces to create games and stories to populate the internet with.  Nick’s first contact with Chandler was mainly asking him hard JavaScript questions, but has since evolved into asking the harder questions - those of life, love, and C#.
