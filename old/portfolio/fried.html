                    Fried Magazine is Denver-based literary magazine that covers topics like art, sciene, and culture, as well as fiction and poetry by contributing writers. They also run a podcast that features local artists and interviews. While the team that started Fried have done a great job networking and creating content, they've had a hard time marketing it due to their lack of technical skills. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Going into the project, I quickly identified that the magazine had great branding and a great URL, but weren't leveraging it as best they could. Their Wordpress site had been sitting idle since launch and needed updates badly; the template was broken in places and the social buttons did nothing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering the low technical skill of the editors working on the site, I decided Wordpress was a good platform to stay with. After properly training the staff to make sure they knew how to semantically structure posts, I moved on to updating Wordpress, uninstalling unnecessary plugins, and fixing their social media sharing options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the redesign, I wanted Fried to stand out from other Denver magazines by leaning heavily on their more literary stance - they published new pieces less often, but those they did publish were long, well-researched think-pieces of a much higher quality than a Buzzfeed listicle. To showcase that, I made a standard hierarchy of all articles on the homepage, designing each like the cover of a book. Since Fried isn't delivering news that needs to be timestamped, I removed any indication of the time and date the article was posted, instead treating them more as a collection of short pieces. Finally, I created a large library of stock images that the editors could use to compliment each piece, so that there was always high-quality photography to accompany every piece of high-quality writing.
