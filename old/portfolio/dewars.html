                    Dewar's Live True site was my first project for the Bacardi family of products, and one of their most polished final pieces. I was brought on to help create a dynamic grid capable of displaying tiles of varying sizes and content, while always remaining evenly spaced and allocated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose to work with Isotope.js because of the depth of customization available - this ended up being a good choice, as the site translates into 81 different languages depending on what country the site is viewed from. Using a general word-space test (German being the most condensed language, Korean being the most verbose) we worked to create a dynamically-resizable content area for each tile, informed by the size of its contents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result is a remarkably flexible grid system that still manages to look intentionally laid out - no matter what country you view it in.
