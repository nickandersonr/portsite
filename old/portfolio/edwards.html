                    Medical Science tradeshows showcase some of the greatest modern advancements in healthcare, but the innovations presented are often so exhaustingly technical that they can be hard to market. Edward's Lifesciences approached us with this problem - their heart valve replacement technology was groundbreaking, but difficult to explain.

                <p>
                    Sitting down with the designers assigned to the project, we sorted through possible ways to display the information, while I helped illuminate some possible approaches - we ended up picking video as the best way to explain the procedure. Watching the CGI valve replacement expand a collapsed artery drove the concept home - after that, most text became ancillary.

                <p>
                    However, this approach required multiple videos per page - autoplaying, transparent and layered, reseting and key-framing to specific timecodes onClick. On top of that, it needed to work on a series touchscreen TVs, a device that was new to pretty much every one of us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was easily one of the most visually-ambitious project I've worked on - I learned more about video codecs than I ever thought would be necessary, and got my hands dirty with the HTML5 video tag in whole new ways. Hopefully the end results speaks for itself.

                    <i>These presentations were designed to be played on local storage, so videos may lag. Also, they are much larger than most computer screens - I suggest zooming out to 70% for a better effect.</i>
