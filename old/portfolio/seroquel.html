				    Digital presentations have largely replaced the brochures that doctors used to receive from drug companies - the representatives delivering this information may only have a few minutes to pitch their product, so empirically evident UI and short load times are mandatory. Every presentation must go through intensive FDA regulation and review, requiring markup that can change quickly and dynamically when new studies are published. And with the extremely high competition in the Pharma industry, companies are insistent on boundary-pushing designs, with complex animations and interactions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pharmaceutical presentations are by far the most challenging projects I've ever undertaken - and the work I'm most proud of. This presentation for Seroquel is a great example - over sixty pages of unique, pixel-pefect design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with a San Francisco-based design firm to help shape the UI and functionality of the presentation, talking through ideas and mocking up possible approaches. Their team was almost entirely based around print, so I was able to help them tailor their designs to fit a digital experience. Once the client and FDA had approved the design flats, I and a small team transferred them into a RoR-based custom MVC that was built specifically to work with SalesForce's Veeva platform - the industry choice for pharma rep data capturing. Using SalesForce's API and tracking systems, we were able to leverage Health Care Provider data to dynamically estimate the cost of a prescription for doctors, show live efficacy data, and adjust statistics as new clinical trials were completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Veeva presentations are private, company-specific apps (as I've mentioned, the industry is very competitive), so I'm only able to present a few individual pages from these projects - however, I welcome the opportunity to show them in person, and talk about them in greater detail.
