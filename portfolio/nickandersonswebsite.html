				    Perhaps its a little self indulgent to include it, but this is my OTHER website, that I use for writing gigs. I needed something simple that did three things - display my brand, list my publications, and link to writing samples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I use a lot of photography in this site - both photos I've taken and stock images. I took special effort to texture them like actual book covers, and use lighting and shadow to create depth. While we statistically do most of our reading online, people still revere the tangibility of books - this is my attempt to account for both worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site was built in Foundation, using MixItUp to provide the filtering effect.
