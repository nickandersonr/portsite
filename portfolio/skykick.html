                    Skykick manages cloud-based migration and backup for Office365 business tools - a very specific niche that is unlikely to generate any interest from anyone not directly involved in Microsoft's business products. And that's the problem - with a business model admittedly as dorky as they come, how do you generate interest?
                </p>
                <p>
                    People who are shopping for business tool management solutions are not the same crowd mindlessly browsing sneakers on or purses online - Skykick told us that most of their inquiries are from panicked IT managers, desperately seeking a swift solution to a major business overhaul. They're probably not going to notice the 500 milliseconds of ease-in on the buttons - they're looking for clear, easy to understand information, as fast as they can take it in.

                    This is the core of Skykick's design - its modern and well designed, but simple - the text and callouts are clear, the sitemap is small and focused. As I worked with their designer, I helped trim away areas of congestion and get the most out of the responsive options at hand. I paid special attention to removing unneeded weight from the front-end implementation, making sure to leave behind something that the (extremely technically skilled) client could continue to tweak and build off of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The end result is sleek and simple - while not the most unique project in my portfolio, it stands out for its pure utility and form; like a Honda Civic, or a KitchenAid Mixer. It does exactly what it sets out to do, brilliantly and efficiently.
