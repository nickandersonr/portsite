                    Much like the Seroquel project, Day in the Life is a Veeva presentation for pharma reps - with one major exception. Though Shire Pharmaceutical produced this presentation, it remains "unbranded" - it exists solely to educate doctors on ADHD, not to promote one single medical solution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with Giant Agency's designers to create a UX that progressed the standards we'd been been developing for Shire, but eschewed brand specific details like color, type-setting, and even now-familiar interactions like button animations and page transitions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Day in the Life follows three different tracks - Pediatric Male, Pediatric Female, and Adult. This required a high amount of dynamically-driven variables to transform the navigation and update references depending on what age group you are viewing. We used SalesForce's API to drive these interactions, so that reps could enter the conversation with a presentation tailored to the doctor they were meeting with. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Veeva presentations are private, company-specific apps (the industry is very competitive), so I'm only able to present a few individual pages from these projects - however, I welcome the opportunity to show them in person, and talk about them in greater detail.
