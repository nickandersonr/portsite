                    The Denver Story Collective is a critique group I run - we have a rotating collection of writers that use it as a platform to refine and share their work. As the group has grown, its become necessary to post bulletins, host documents, and share meeting info. While most of this can be handled through Meetup.com, the site's design options are limited at best.
                </p>

                    I created this site in order to market and promote the DSC - It's the "face" of the group, creating a visual feel that positions us in Denver's aging writing scene as a young, fresh alternative. In surveying the critique groups Denver has to offer, I found that nearly all of them catered to retirees and hobbyists - not emerging talent. They had promotional materials to match - lots of ClipArt logos of pens and books. I took special effort to brand the DSC as a merging of traditional print and digital, the most prominent feature being the blinking cursor that replaces the 'i' in 'collective'. I paired that with stock photography that matched the demographic I was trying to appeal to - a little less Mark Twain, a little more Tao Lin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site itself is very simple - a one-page bootstrap static page with embedded links through the Meetup API. In the coming months I'm looking forward to expanding the publications section into a bookshelf of our published author's work.
